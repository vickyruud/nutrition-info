4,7,"It was so delicious! I always love reading Marta's recipes, easy to follow, entertaining and pure flavour. Soaking the rice really makes the trick, it's the first time I make this dish and I couldn't be happier. I didn't have shrimp (covid-19 limitations) but it still came out great! I also like that you get one full meal in just one pot! Works great as a meal prep. I just vary the sides."
